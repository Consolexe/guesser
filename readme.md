*What is this?*
This is a very simplistic guessing game i made for a Tutorial.
Nothing special, but it will teach the audience some basics.

I will eventually polish the code, maybe moving to pygame to add some graphics.

*Roadmap*

- Move entirely to files for saving userdata
- Add a "shop" to spend points in(buy an upgrade that guesses for you for example)
- Move to pygame and a 2D setting
